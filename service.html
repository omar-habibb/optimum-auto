      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto">
       Every wash we deliver is built on one simple promise: clean, safe, and consistent care for your car’s exterior.
        Your car is cleaned exactly where it’s parked — no keys, no movement, no hassle.    
        Every wash is carried out by our trained team, using quiet, low-noise tools that respect both your peace and your environment. 
        Each step of the wash has its own microfiber towel — body, glass, lower car edge, and drying. 
        By never mixing towels between steps, we protect your paint, keep glass crystal clear, and leave every detail flawless.
        This level of care ensures a safe, scratch-free clean that protects your paint and delivers a flawless, streak-free finish every time — all while conserving water and reducing waste to care for the environment too.

      <h3>Refund & Exchange Policy</h3>
      <P>
        At Optimum Auto, we aim to provide a seamless and reliable service. To ensure transparency and fairness. Please review the following terms regarding refunds and subscription changes:
      </P>
      <h4>Refunds</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Payment Errors:</strong> If a customer is charged incorrectly due to a system or billing error, a full refund will be issued upon verification.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cancellation Within First 2 Weeks:</strong> If a customer chooses to cancel their subscription within 14 days from the start date, they are eligible for a refund of 50% of the total amount paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cancellation After 2 Weeks:</strong> Requests for cancellation made after the initial two-week period from the start date are not eligible for a refund.
      </p>
      <h4>Plan Changes</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Upgrading from 3-Day to 6-Day Plan:</strong>
        <br>-Customers may upgrade their plan within 7 days of the subscription start date, with the price difference applied accordingly.
        <br>-After this period, upgrades can still be made, but we recommend scheduling them for the upcoming month, as it would be more cost-effective for the customer.
        <br>-The upgraded plan will be applied starting from the following week to ensure proper planning and availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Downgrading from 6-Day to 3-Day Plan:</strong>
        <br>-Downgrades can be requested within the first 3 days of the subscription start date for a refund of the price difference.
        <br>-After that, customers may still downgrade at any time, but no refund will be issued. It is recommended to apply such changes for the upcoming month.
        <br>-The change to the downgraded plan will be processed and applied instantly after confirmation.
      </p>
      <h4>Missed Washes</h4>
      <p>
        We strive to maintain reliable service and consistent scheduling. In the rare case that a wash cannot be completed due to unexpected or uncontrollable circumstances (such as weather or logistical challenges), we will notify the customer in advance via WhatsApp, and do our best to minimize any disruption to the service. Our team always aims to operate with professionalism and transparency.
