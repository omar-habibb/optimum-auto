      <h3>Refund & Exchange Policy</h3>
      <P>
        At Optimum Auto, we aim to provide a seamless and reliable service. To ensure transparency and fairness. Please review the following terms regarding refunds and subscription changes:
      </P>
      <h4>Refunds</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Payment Errors:</strong> If a customer is charged incorrectly due to a system or billing error, a full refund will be issued upon verification.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cancellation Within First 2 Weeks:</strong> If a customer chooses to cancel their subscription within 14 days from the start date, they are eligible for a refund of 50% of the total amount paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cancellation After 2 Weeks:</strong> Requests for cancellation made after the initial two-week period from the start date are not eligible for a refund.
      </p>
      <h4>Plan Changes</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Upgrading from 3-Day to 6-Day Plan:</strong>
        <br>-Customers may upgrade their plan within 7 days of the subscription start date, with the price difference applied accordingly.
        <br>-After this period, upgrades can still be made, but we recommend scheduling them for the upcoming month, as it would be more cost-effective for the customer.
        <br>-The upgraded plan will be applied starting from the following week to ensure proper planning and availability.

      <p>
        <strong>Downgrading from 6-Day to 3-Day Plan:</strong>

        <br>-After that, customers may still downgrade at any time, but no refund will be issued. It is recommended to apply such changes for the upcoming month.
        <br>-The change to the downgraded plan will be processed and applied instantly after confirmation.
      </p>
      <h4>Missed Washes</h4>
      <p>
        We strive to maintain reliable service and consistent scheduling. In the rare case that a wash cannot be completed due to unexpected or uncontrollable circumstances (such as weather or logistical challenges), we will notify the customer in advance via WhatsApp, and do our best to minimize any disruption to the service. Our team always aims to operate with professionalism and transparency.
